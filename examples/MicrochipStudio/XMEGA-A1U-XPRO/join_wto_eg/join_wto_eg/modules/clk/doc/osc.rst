XMEGA devices have a flexible clock system supporting a large number of clock sources. It incorporates both accurate
internal oscillators and external crystal oscillator and resonator support. A high-frequency phase locked loop (PLL) and
clock prescalers can be used to generate a wide range of clock frequencies. A calibration feature (DFLL) is available,
and can be used for automatic run-time calibration of the internal oscillators to remove frequency drift over voltage and
temperature. An oscillator failure monitor can be enabled to issue a non-maskable interrupt and switch to the internal
oscillator if the external oscillator or PLL fails.
