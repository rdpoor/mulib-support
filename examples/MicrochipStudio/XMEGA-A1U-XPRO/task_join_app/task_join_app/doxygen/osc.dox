\defgroup doc_driver_osc OSC Drivers

XMEGA devices have a flexible clock system supporting a large number of clock sources. It incorporates both accurate
internal oscillators and external crystal oscillator and resonator support.

\section doc_driver_osc_basic_and_practice OSC Basics and Best Practice

A high-frequency phase locked loop (PLL) and clock prescalers can be used to generate a wide range of clock frequencies. 
A calibration feature (DFLL) is available,and can be used for automatic run-time calibration of the internal oscillators to remove frequency drift over voltage and
temperature. An oscillator failure monitor can be enabled to issue a non-maskable interrupt and switch to the internal
oscillator if the external oscillator or PLL fails.
