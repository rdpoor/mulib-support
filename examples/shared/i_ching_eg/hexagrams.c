The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and\nsince it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image\nis heaven. Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions\nin space and is therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the\nbasis of this motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time\nand the power of persisting in time, that is, duration. The power represented\nby the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action\non the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the\nuniverse, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity.\nIn relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy\nman or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens\nand develops their higher nature.",
    .jd = "THE CREATIVE works sublime success, Furthering through perseverance.",
    .j_cm = "According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality\nof success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual\ndraws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal\ndepths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his\nhappiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance\nin what is right. The specific meanings of the four attributes became\nthe subject of speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered\nby \"sublime\" means literally \"head,\" \"origin,\" \"great.\" This is why Confucius\nsays in explaining it: \"Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative;\nall beings owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven.\"\nFor this attribute inheres in the other three as well. The beginning of\nall things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to\nbecome real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these\narchetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and the process\nis represented by an image from nature: \"The clouds pass and the rain does\nits work, and all individual beings flow into their forms.\" Applies to\nthe human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable\nsuccess: \"Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he completes\nthe six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them at the\nright time, as though on six dragons.\" The six steps are the six different\npositions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon\nsymbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and\ngiving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running\nthrough end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each\nstep attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer\na hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential. The act of\ncreation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success,\nthe work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation\nof form. This is expressed in the two terms \"furthering\" (literally, \"creating\nthat which accords with the nature of a given being\") and \"persevering\"\n(literally, \"correct and firm\"). \"The course of the Creative alters and\nshapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then it keeps\nthem in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus does it show itself to further\nthrough perseverance.\" In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the\ngreat man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in\ncreating order: \"He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands\nare united in peace.\" Another line of speculation goes still further in\nseparating the words \"sublime,\" \"success,\" \"furthering,\" \"perseverance,\"\nand parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity,\nwhich, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes,\nit links love. To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate\nand organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute\nfurthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which\neach receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and\nwhich constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated\nwith wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can\ntherefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached\nin the commentary called WÃªn Yen , later formed the bridge connecting\nthe philosophy of the \"five stages (elements) of change,\" as laid down in\nthe Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes,\nwhich is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles.\nIn the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened\nthe way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.",

    .i_cm = "Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien,\nof which heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete\nrevolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means\nthat each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time.\nSince it is the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also\ncreated the idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that\nnever stops nor slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending\ncourse. This duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the\nCreative. With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop\nhimself so that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in\nevery way, by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading.\nThus he attains that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting\nthe fields of his activity.",

The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged,\ndynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In\nwinter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes\nactive again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result\nthe creative forces on earth begin to stir again. Here this creative\nforce is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In\nterms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized.\nNonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be\ninfluenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength,\nhe bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle\nand draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time will\nfulfill itself.

The attribute of the\nhexagram is devotion; its image is the earth. It is the perfect complement\nof THE CREATIVE--the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does\nnot combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast\nto spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time,\nthe female-maternal as against the male-paternal.\n\nHowever, as applied to human affairs, the principle of this complementary\nrelationship is found not only in the relation between\nman and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and\nbetween father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears\nin the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.\nBut strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a\nclearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself\nof course the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute\nof devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation\nto the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative;\nthen it is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and\ntries to stand as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become\nevil. The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative,\nwhich is productive of evil to both.",

    .j_cm = "The four fundamental aspects of the Creative--\"sublime success, furthering\nthrough perseverance\"--are also attributed to the Receptive. Here, however,\nthe perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive\nconnotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of\nthe Creative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial\nthrough a specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification,\n\"of a mare,\" is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs\nto earth just as the dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over\nthe plains is taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This\nis the symbol chosen because the mare combines the strength and swiftness\nof the horse with the gentleness and devotion of the cow. Only because\nnature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative\ncan it make these impulses real. Nature's richness lies in its power to\nnourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to give then\nbeauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the Creative\nthat begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. Applied\nto human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in conformity\nwith the situation. The person in questions not in an independent position,\nbut is acting as an assistant. This means that he must achieve something.\nIt is not his task to try to lead--that would only make him lose the way-but\nto let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of\nacceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets\nhimself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation\nwhat is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate. Since\nthere is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in the\nhour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The\ntime of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and\nsouth symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as\nnature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize\nall one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to\nfind friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time\nof toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need\nthis solitude. The east symbolized the place where a man receives orders\nfrom his master, and the north the place where he reports on what he has\ndone. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he\nmust do without companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled\nby fictional hates and favoritism."

The earth in its devotion carries\nall things, good and evil,, without exception.

On the other hand,\nmovement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality\nof the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight\nline and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate\nbetween lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result\nfrom straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive\naccommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its\nown. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a\nsquare. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken\naway, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special\npurpose of its own, nor of any effort' yet everything turns out as it\nshould. Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness.\nIt tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness.

At first it acts on\nthose who are inwardly receptive. But the circle grows larger and larger.\nThe root of all influence lies in one's own inner being: given true and vigorous\nexpression in word and deed, its effect is great. The effect is but the reflection\nof something that emanates from one's own heart. Any deliberate intention\nof an effect would only destroy the possibility of producing it. Confucius\nsays about this line:\nThe superior man abides in his room. If his words are well spoken,\nhe meets with assent at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How\nmuch more then from near by! If the superior man abides in his room and\nhis words are not well spoken, he meets with contradiction at a distance\nof more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! Words go\nforth from one's own person and exert their influence on men. Deeds are\nborn close at hand and become visible far away. Words and deeds are the\nhinge and bowspring of the superior man. As hinge and bowspring move, they\nbring honor or disgrace. Through words and deeds the superior man moves\nheaven and earth .
