/**
 * @brief Parse a date in RFC 1123 format and store the restults in a struct tm.
 *
 * Note: an RFC 1123 date has the following form:
 *
 *    Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:06:21 GMT
 *
 * This parser is strict:
 * - Exactly one space appears between tokens
 * - Day and Month fields are Capitalized, GMT is UPPER CASE.
 *
 * On success, returns a pointer to the first character following "GMT" and the
 * struct tm is filled in.  On any error, returns NULL and struct tm is cleared.
 *
 * @param s Pointer to string to be parsed
 * @param tm time structure to be filled in
 * @return Pointer to character following "GMT" on success, NULL otherwise.
